# 🌌 Physics Sandisk (AI-Powered Engine)

> **Zero dependencies. Infinite physics. One single HTML file.**

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0-blueviolet) ![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-single--file-success) ![AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-Embedded-cyan)

## 🚀 Why This Project is "Smart"
Most web projects require `npm install`, 500MB of `node_modules`, and a complex build pipeline. **Physics Sandisk** is different. 

 It demonstrates **Advanced Front-End Mastery** by encapsulating a full Physics Engine, a UI Library, and an AI Command Processor entirely within a **single 150KB text file**.

### Core Capabilities
*   **🧠 Embedded AI Assistant**: A natural language processor written in raw JavaScript that interprets commands like *"spawn 500 bouncy balls"* or *"enable chaos mode"*. No external API calls needed.
*   **⚡ Custom Physics Engine**: A hand-written physics integrator handling gravity, air friction, collision detection, and momentum conservation at 60+ FPS.
*   **🎨 Glassmorphism & Neon UI**: A state-of-the-art aesthetic using pure CSS (no Tailwind, no Bootstrap), featuring dynamic glows, frosted glass effects, and mobile-responsive layouts.
*   **📱 Universal Touch Support**: Works seamlessly on Desktops, Tablets, and Mobile devices with custom touch-to-mouse event simulation.

## 🎮 How to Run
1.  **Download**: Just save `index.html`.
2.  **Run**: Double-click it.
3.  **Enjoy**: That's it. No servers. No installation.

## 🤖 AI Commands to Try
Open the chat panel and type:
*   `"spawn rain"` → Starts a particle rain simulation.
*   `"gravity 0.05"` → Enters zero-gravity mode.
*   `"slow motion"` + `"explosion"` → Cinematic physics effects.
*   `"magnet on"` → Activates a mouse-following magnetic field.
*   `"nuke"` → Stress-tests the engine with hundreds of particles.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Language**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API (High-DPI Optimized)
*   **Styling**: Modern CSS3 (Variables, Backdrop Filters, Flexbox/Grid)
*   **Architecture**: Monolithic Single-File (Portable & Archival-Ready)
